beempy CLI
~~~~~~~~~~
`beempy` is a convenient CLI utility that enables you to manage your wallet, transfer funds, check
balances and more.

Using the Wallet
----------------
`beempy` lets you leverage your BIP38 encrypted wallet to perform various actions on your accounts.

The first time you use `beempy`, you will be prompted to enter a password. This password will be used to encrypt
the `beempy` wallet, which contains your private keys.

You can change the password via `changewalletpassphrase` command.

::

    beempy changewalletpassphrase


From this point on, every time an action requires your private keys, you will be prompted ot enter
this password (from CLI as well as while using `steem` library).

To bypass password entry, you can set an environment variable ``UNLOCK``.

::

    UNLOCK=mysecretpassword beempy transfer <recipient_name> 100 STEEM

Using a key json file
---------------------

A key_file.json can be used to provide private keys to beempy:
::

    {
        "account_a": {"posting": "5xx", "active": "5xx"},
        "account_b": {"posting": "5xx"},
    }

with

::

    beempy --keys key_file.json command

When set, the wallet cannot be used.

Common Commands
---------------
First, you may like to import your Steem account:

::

    beempy importaccount


You can also import individual private keys:

::

   beempy addkey <private_key>

Listing accounts:

::

   beempy listaccounts

Show balances:

::

   beempy balance account_name1 account_name2

Sending funds:

::

   beempy transfer --account <account_name> <recipient_name> 100 STEEM memo

Upvoting a post:

::

   beempy upvote --account <account_name> https://steemit.com/funny/@mynameisbrian/the-content-stand-a-comic


Setting Defaults
----------------
For a more convenient use of ``beempy`` as well as the ``beem`` library, you can set some defaults.
This is especially useful if you have a single Steem account.

::

   beempy set default_account test
   beempy set default_vote_weight 100

   beempy config
    +---------------------+--------+
    | Key                 | Value  |
    +---------------------+--------+
    | default_account     | test   |
    | default_vote_weight | 100    |
    +---------------------+--------+

If you've set up your `default_account`, you can now send funds by omitting this field:

::

    beempy transfer <recipient_name> 100 STEEM memo
