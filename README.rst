Installation
============
The minimal working python version is 3.6.x

beem can be installed parallel to python-steem.

For Debian and Ubuntu, please ensure that the following packages are installed:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools

The following package speeds up beempy:
.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python3-gmpy2

For Fedora and RHEL-derivatives, please ensure that the following packages are installed:

.. code:: bash

    sudo yum install gcc openssl-devel python-devel

For OSX, please do the following::

    brew install openssl
    export CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include $CFLAGS"
    export LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib $LDFLAGS"

For Termux on Android, please install the following packages:

Note: Use latest [f-droid Termux package](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) to resolve outdated repository issues.

.. code:: bash

    pkg install clang python rust

Termux continued: Set CARGO_BUILD_TARGET environment variable to appropriate device target architecture. Example below:

.. code:: bash

   export CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=aarch64-linux-android

Signing and Verify can be fasten (200 %) by installing cryptography (you may need to replace pip3 by pip):

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install -U cryptography

or (you may need to replace pip3 by pip):

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install -U secp256k1prp

Install or update beem by pip(you may need to replace pip3 by pip)::

    pip3 install -U beem

You can install beem from this repository if you want the latest
but possibly non-compiling version::

    git clone https://github.com/holgern/beem.git
    cd beem
    python3 setup.py build

    python3 setup.py install --user

Run tests after install::

    pytest


Installing beem with conda-forge
--------------------------------

Installing beem from the conda-forge channel can be achieved by adding conda-forge to your channels with::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge

Once the conda-forge channel has been enabled, beem can be installed with::

    conda install beem

Signing and Verify can be fasten (200 %) by installing cryptography::

    conda install cryptography

beem can be updated by::

    conda update beem

CLI tool beempy
---------------
A command line tool is available. The help output shows the available commands:

    beempy --help

Ledger support
--------------
For Ledger (Nano S) signing, the following package must be installed:

    pip3 install ledgerblue

Stand alone version of CLI tool beempy
--------------------------------------
With the help of pyinstaller, a stand alone version of beempy was created for Windows, OSX and linux.
Each version has just to be unpacked and can be used in any terminal. The packed directories
can be found under release. Each release has a hash sum, which is created directly in the build-server
before transmitting the packed file. Please check the hash-sum after downloading.
